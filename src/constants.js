Python, NumPy, yfinance, Matplotlib

Developed robust pricing models for European call and put options using Python.

Implemented both the Black-Scholes-Merton model and the N-step Binomial Tree model to simulate and compare option pricing under varying market conditions.

Utilized libraries like NumPy for numerical computation and yfinance to fetch real-time financial data.

Visualized and analyzed payoff graphs to interpret option outcomes and validate model performance, providing valuable insights into risk and reward structures.`,
